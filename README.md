# G4Lyfe_Engine-Mark-II

## By Khinshan Khan (Period 10)

#### The following outlines the features I implemented beyond the course requirements:

### Meshes

#### As outlined in the MDL.spec file, user has to put the `.obj` file in the `obj_files/` directory. They can then call the file in an `.mdl` script as

`mesh <color>:mini_cooper.obj`

where <color> is the next feature, but it can just be left blank and default coloring will be used.

DISCLAIMER: Only deals with `v` and `f` lines, ignores the rest (ie I don't bother with vertex normals nor textures, etcetera)
